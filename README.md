# Python Workout

This repo follows along the [Python Workout](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout) book, which was published by Manning and written by Reuven M. Lerner.

All code and content belongs to them. This repo is merely used to allow me to store my work in one centralized place.

## `pywk` conda environment

This project relies on you using the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file to recreate the `pywk` [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html). To do so, please run the following commands:

```bash
# create pywk environment from the environment.yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# activate (switch into) the pywk conda environment
conda activate pywk
```
